## E0 — Shakespeare sanity (core, γ = 1, D=128, 6 levels)

`uv run python -m hbwm.sanity_shakespeare --steps 1000`

| device | params | step 0 val loss | step 1000 val loss | wall-clock (s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mps | 6,356,992 | 5.600 | 1.603 | 5176.8 |

Val loss fell monotonically from ln(256) ≈ 5.5 nats at step 0 to well below the ≈2.2 nats bar by
step 100 (2.477), continuing down to a best of **1.474 at step 600**; steps 600-1000 wobble in the
1.47-1.60 range (700: 1.542, 800: 1.604, 900: 1.501, 1000: 1.603) rather than strictly decreasing,
which is within the "minor wobbles allowed" tolerance in the task brief. Full per-100-step curve in
`runs/e0_shakespeare/log.json`.

**Timing caveat:** this run's wall-clock is not representative of awake MPS throughput. The machine
was asleep/throttled for part of the run (closed lid, dark-wake only) — the first 100 steps include
about 40 minutes of sleep, and steps 100-1000 ran at roughly 2.5-3.75 s/step under dark-wake
throttling. A clean foreground benchmark of the same config measured about 2.1 s/step after a
one-time MPS warm-up. Use the foreground figure, not the 5176.8 s elapsed_s above, to calibrate
later run-time estimates.

```
To be or any thing,
And the dishonour of the fair worldly knaves.

## Dataset grid9

Generated with `uv run python -m hbwm.envs.dataset --config experiments/data/grid9.json` (wall-clock ~31s for 27,000 episodes; grid=9x9, 3 objects, episode_len=96, T=1164 tokens/episode).

Sanity check (`probe_test` split, n=2000):
```
uv run python -c "from hbwm.envs.dataset import EpisodeData as E; d=E('data/grid9','probe_test'); import numpy as np; print(d.n, d.T, d.moved.mean(), (d.reobserved_t>=0).mean(), d.visible.mean())"
2000 1164 0.5205 0.311 0.09749828178694159
```

- Fraction of episodes with an object moved: **0.5205** (expected ~0.45-0.5)
- Fraction of episodes where the moved object is re-observed before the episode ends: **0.311** (expected ~0.3-0.45)
- Fraction of (t, obj) pairs where the object is visible: **0.0975** (expected ~0.1-0.2)
